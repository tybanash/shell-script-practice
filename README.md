# shell-script-practice
Created this simple addition script to refresh my knowledge on shell scripting.
I ran this script on an AWS EC2 instance.
It can also be run on any linux OS.

This script adds 5 numbers and returns the result. 
I used parameters so the user will be required to pass arguements.
